🚀 How to Use
1. 🔧 Install Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Or manually install:

    pip install torch transformers gradio

2. 🏋️‍♂️ Train the Model

To train the chatbot on a small custom dataset (for demo):

    python train.py

This will:
- Fine-tune `gpt2` on a few dummy conversations.
- Save the model to `./mini-chatgpt-model/`.

⚠️ You can replace the training texts inside `train.py` with your own dialogue data.

3. 💬 Chat with the Bot (Terminal Mode)

After training, start chatting:

    python chat.py

Type your message and get a response from the bot. To exit, type:

    exit

4. 📱 (Optional) Add a GUI (via `app.py`)

You can later use Gradio or Streamlit to create a simple web app.  
Currently, `app.py` is empty. You can build on it like this:

    import gradio as gr

    def chat_with_bot(user_input):
        return "Bot reply"

    gr.Interface(fn=chat_with_bot, inputs="text", outputs="text").launch()
🧪 Example Training Data Used
texts = [
    "Hello, how are you?",
    "I am a mini chat model.",
    "This is a test sentence.",
    "Let's train a transformer.",
    "Transformers are powerful!"
]

You can replace this with better conversation-style data for real results.
📦 Requirements
- transformers
- torch
- gradio (optional, for app.py UI)
